The program I used previously broke, so I made this small script.
I'll probably update a bit more later on.

Example Code

```
# Initiate with Novel ID
downloader = NovelpiaDownloader(118288)

# Downloads every episode
downloader.download_episode_all()

# Download a single episode based on ID
downloader.download_episode(1076989)
```
